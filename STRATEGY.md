# 🏆 CSIRO Competition Strategy - Path to Top Leaderboard

## 🎯 Key Insights Discovered

### 1. **CRITICAL DATA STRUCTURE FINDINGS**
- **Dry_Total = Dry_Clover + Dry_Dead + Dry_Green** (exact relationship!)
  - Must enforce this constraint in predictions
  - Use constraint loss during training
- **Data splitting**: Must split by `image_path`, NOT `sample_id`
  - Each image has 5 targets (one per target_name)
  - 357 unique images → 1,785 samples
  - Test set: 1 image → 5 predictions needed

### 2. **TARGET DISTRIBUTION ANALYSIS**
```
Dry_Clover_g:  mean=6.65,  std=12.12,  range=[0, 71.79]
Dry_Dead_g:    mean=12.04, std=12.40,  range=[0, 83.84]
Dry_Green_g:   mean=26.62, std=25.40,  range=[0, 157.98]
Dry_Total_g:   mean=45.32, std=27.98,  range=[1.04, 185.70]  ⚠️ HIGHEST VARIANCE
GDM_g:         mean=33.27, std=24.94,  range=[1.04, 157.98]
```

### 3. **FEATURE IMPORTANCE**
- **NDVI**: Correlation = 0.246 (moderate)
- **Height**: Correlation = 0.328 (stronger)
- **State**: Significant variation (NSW: 39.70, Tas: 19.03, Vic: 23.58, WA: 18.83)
- **Species**: Major impact (Phalaris: 59.23, Fescue: 46.68, Clover: 18.85)

### 4. **IMAGE PROPERTIES**
- Resolution: 2000x1000 (high resolution!)
- Current model input: 224x224 (could use higher resolution)

## 🚀 STRATEGY IMPLEMENTED

### ✅ Phase 1: Multi-Task Model (CURRENT - RUNNING)
**Status**: Training in progress

**Architecture**:
- ResNet50 backbone (pretrained ImageNet)
- Shared feature extractor (1024 → 512)
- Feature fusion with NDVI + Height
- Separate heads for each of 5 targets
- Constraint loss: Dry_Total = sum(components)

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Proper image-based train/val split (285 train / 72 val images)
- ✅ Multi-task learning (all 5 targets simultaneously)
- ✅ NDVI + Height feature fusion
- ✅ Constraint enforcement
- ✅ Weighted loss (Dry_Total gets 1.5x weight)

**Expected Improvement**: ~30-40% better than baseline

### 📋 Phase 2: Advanced Techniques (READY TO IMPLEMENT)

#### A. Higher Resolution Training
- Current: 224x224
- Target: 384x384 or 512x512
- Strategy: Use EfficientNet-B4 or ConvNeXt
- Expected gain: 5-10% improvement

#### B. Test-Time Augmentation (TTA)
- Average predictions over multiple augmentations
- Expected gain: 2-5% improvement

#### C. Ensemble Methods
- Train multiple models with different:
  - Architectures (ResNet50, EfficientNet, Vision Transformer)
  - Seeds (different initializations)
  - Hyperparameters (learning rates, batch sizes)
- Expected gain: 5-10% improvement

#### D. Pseudo-Labeling
- Use confident predictions on test set
- Retrain with pseudo-labels
- Expected gain: 2-5% improvement

#### E. Advanced Features
- Add State and Species embeddings
- Use multi-scale features (FPN)
- Expected gain: 3-7% improvement

#### F. Post-Processing
- Enforce Dry_Total = sum constraint
- Clip predictions to reasonable ranges
- Expected gain: 1-3% improvement
